// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// ONLINE HOLDING — shown to an online student who is not in a group yet.
//
// LIVE. It subscribes to the student's own participant doc and, the moment group_id
// appears, hands control back to Play (onGrouped), which re-runs routeToPhase. It used to be
// static text behind a routeToPhase that read the doc ONCE, so a student parked here when the
// instructor formed groups sat here until they reloaded.
//
// ⚠ The exit condition is participants/<pid>.group_id ALONE — not the group opening, not
// seats_locked_at. What comes next (the reveal, then the game) is Play's decision.
// ⚠ onGrouped must re-run routeToPhase AND apply the reveal gate. Setting phase 'matched'
// directly — WaitingRoom's classroom onMatched pattern — skips the reveal.
//
// Deliberately a per-game copy, NOT game-ui's WaitingRoom: that registers RTDB presence (read
// only by classroom matching), carries the attendance-code-only latecomer_absent branch, and
// has classroom copy — none of which apply online. Modelled on grays2's
// phases/OnlineWaiting.tsx. Every stage game spawned from this template inherits it.
